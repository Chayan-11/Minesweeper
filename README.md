# Minesweeper
Minesweeper is single-player logic based computer game played on rectangular board whose objective is to locate a predetermined number of randomly placed mines in the shortest possible time by clicking on safe squares while avoiding the squares with mines. If the player clicks on a mine, the game ends. Otherwise, a number between 0 and 8 is displayed that identifies the total number of mines present in the eight neighboring squares.
